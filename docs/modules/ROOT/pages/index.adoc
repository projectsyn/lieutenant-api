The Lieutenant API provides the central inventory of all tenants and clusters managed by Project Syn.

It's a REST API based on https://github.com/projectsyn/lieutenant-api/blob/master/openapi.yaml[OpenAPI 3] and is designed to be a wrapper around the various CRDs managed by the xref:lieutenant-operator::index.adoc[Lieutenant Operator].

[TIP]
The `/docs` endpoint of the API hosts an interactive https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui[Swagger UI].
